1️⃣. In Python 3.12, there are two types of special keywords, Reserved Keywords (Hard Keywords)
    These are 35 keywords that have a fixed meaning in Python and cannot be used as variable names or function names.
    


   False    await    else      import    pass  
   None     break    except    in        raise  
   True     class    finally   is        return  
   and      continue  for      lambda    try  
   as       def      from      nonlocal  while  
   assert   del      global    not       with  
   async    elif     if        or        yield


2️⃣. Soft Keywords
    Soft keywords act as keywords in specific contexts, but they can still be used as variable names in other cases. 

    match
    case
    _
    type

 match and case are used in structural pattern matching but can still be used as variable names.

 _ (underscore) is used as a wildcard in pattern matching.

 type is now a soft keyword in Python 3.12, but it is still a built-in function.

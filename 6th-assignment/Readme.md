This repository contains solutions and code examples for the following three Python lessons:

---

## 🧯 Lesson 09: Exception Handling

**Purpose:**  
Exception Handling allows you to catch and handle runtime errors gracefully instead of crashing the program. Python provides a structured way using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.

**Topics Covered:**
- Basic `try-except` usage
- Handling specific exceptions like `ZeroDivisionError`, `TypeError`
- Using `else` when no error occurs
- Using `finally` for cleanup code

## 📁 Lesson 10: File Handling

**Purpose:**  
File handling in Python allows you to read from and write to files. It is essential for storing data persistently (e.g., logs, user input, reports).

**Topics Covered:**
- Opening, reading, and writing files using `open()`
- File modes: `"r"`, `"w"`, `"a"`, `"x"`
- Using `with` block for safe file handling
- Reading line by line and writing content

## 📅 Lesson 11: Math & Date Time Calendar

**Purpose:**  
This lesson covers two powerful built-in modules: `math` and `datetime`. These are helpful for working with numerical and date/time operations.

**Topics Covered:**
- `math` module: `sqrt()`, `pow()`, `ceil()`, `floor()`, and constants like `pi`
- `datetime` module: `datetime`, `date`, `time`, `timedelta`, and formatting using `strftime()`
- `time` module: timestamps and current system time
- `calendar` module: printing calendars and finding weekdays

### ✅ How to Run

Each lesson's code is saved in a `.py` file.  
Simply run the Python files one by one to see the output examples in action.

```bash
python exception_handling.py
python file_handling.py
python the_date_&_time.py
---bash

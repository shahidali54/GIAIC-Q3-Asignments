**This Assignment contains key concepts from three important lessons in Python. Below is a brief explanation of each lesson:**

**Lesson 05: Control Flow & Loops**
Control Flow and Loops are used to manage the execution flow of a program in Python.

- **if, elif, else:** These are conditional statements used to execute code based on specific conditions.
- **for loop:** Iterates over a list or range, executing code for each item.
- **while loop:** Continues executing a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

**Lesson 06: Lists, Tuples & Dictionary**
Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries are used to store and manage data in Python.

- **Lists:** These are mutable (modifiable) and ordered collections that can store different data types.
- **Tuples:** These are immutable (unchangeable) and ordered collections.
- **Dictionary:** These store data in key-value pairs, allowing efficient data retrieval.

**Lesson 07: The Set & Frozenset**
Sets and Frozensets are used to store unique values.

- **Set:** An unordered collection that does not allow duplicate values and is mutable.
- **Frozenset:** An immutable version of a set that cannot be changed after creation. It is hashable and can be used as a dictionary key.
These concepts are essential for understanding and effectively manipulating data and control flow in Python.

# Lesson 08: Modules & Functions

# MODULES:
"""A module in Python is basically a separate file or library which can be pre-made (built-in)
   or you can create your own (custom).
   The purpose of modules is to organize and reuse code, like a ready-made toolbox."""

#<================= Here we are using 3 built-in modules: ==========================>
""" 1. math --> For mathematical calculations (sqrt, pow, sin, etc.)
    2. random --> To generate random values (random numbers or random choices)
    3. os --> To work with the Operating System (files/folders handling)"""

#<============================= Importing modules ==================================>
import math    # Importing math module to use math formulas
import random  # Importing random module to generate random values
import os      # Importing os module to work with folders and files


# math module
print("Square root of 64:", math.sqrt(64))  
# math.sqrt(64) means: find the square root of 64 (result will be 8.0)

# random module
print("Random number between 1 and 10:", random.randint(1, 10))  
# random.randint(1, 10) means: print a random number between 1 and 10

print("Random choice from list:", random.choice(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']))  
# random.choice() means: randomly select and print one item from the list

# os module
print("Current working directory:", os.getcwd())  
# os.getcwd() means: print the path of the current working directory

print("List of files/folders in current directory:", os.listdir())  
# os.listdir() means: print the list of all files and folders inside the current directory

#<=========================== CREATING CUSTOM MODULES ================================>

# Importing our custom module (my_module.py)
import my_module

# Using greet() function from custom module
print(my_module.greet("Shahid"))

# Using add() function from custom module
print("Sum of 30 and 40 is:", my_module.add(30, 40))

# Using pi_value from custom module
print("Value of Pi from custom module:", my_module.pi_value)

# Using only single function
from my_module import greet
print(greet("Shahid"))

#<=================== Third-Party Modules (External Libraries) =======================>
"""Third-party modules are those which are not pre-installed with Python.
   We need to install them manually using pip or any package manager.
   requests (used to make HTTP requests)"""

# install the requests library
# pip install requests

""" This is an example of a third-party module.
    We are using 'requests' to fetch data from an external API."""

import requests # third-party module

# Make a request to an API and fetch data
response = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")

# Check the status code of the API response
print("API Status Code:", response.status_code)

# Print the JSON data received from the API
print("API Response JSON Data:", response.json())


#<================== Different Ways to Import Modules in Python =================>

# Basic Import Method
# This imports the entire module. We will need to use 'module_name.' prefix to access its functions/variables.
import math
print("Value of Pi using basic import:", math.pi)


# Import with Alias
# Giving a short name (alias) to the module for easier access.
import numpy as np
print("Numpy array using alias:", np.array([1, 2, 3]))

# Import Specific Functions or Variables
# Importing only specific parts of a module.
from math import sqrt, pi
print("Square root using specific import:", sqrt(16))
print("Pi value using specific import:", pi)

# Import Specific Functions with Aliases
# Importing specific functions and renaming them for convenience.
from math import sqrt as s, pi as p
print("Square root using alias:", s(25))
print("Pi value using alias:", p)


# Import Everything (Wildcard Import)
"""Imports all functions and variables without using the module name.
   Not recommended for large modules as it clutters the namespace."""
from math import *
print("Sin value using wildcard import:", sin(0))



#<====================== Functions in Python =====================================>
"""A function in Python is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task.
Functions help make code modular and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)."""

# Defining a simple function

# Built-in Function
# Built-in functions are available by default as soon as Python runs.
print("Hello! World")

# User-Defined Function
# A function we create ourselves is called a user-defined function

# Simple Functions
def my_function():
    print("Hello! Welcome to GIAIC")
my_function()


# Function with parameter
def greet_user(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! How are you?")

# Function with return value
def add_numbers(a, b):

    return avg

my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
average = calculate_average(my_list)
print("Average is:", average)

# Functions defined inside built-in modules
# We need to import modules like random to access their functions.
import random  # built-in module
print("Random float using random.random():", random.random())


# Immutable vs Mutable Objects with Functions
def modify_value(x):
    x = 10
    print("Within function:", x)

# Immutable object (integer)
x = 5
print("Original:", x)

# Mutable Object (List)
def modify_list(lst):
    lst.append(4)
    print("Within function: ", lst, " - ID:", id(lst))

# Mutable object (list)
lst = [1, 2, 3]
print("Original:", lst, " - ID:", id(lst))
modify_list(lst)
print("After function:", lst, " - ID:", id(lst))


# Function arguments are the values or variables passed into a function when it is called.
def greetings(name):
    "This is docstring of greetings function"
    print ("Hello {}".format(name))
    return

greetings("Shahid")
greetings("Subhan")

# Keyword Arguments
def printinfo( name, age ):

#====================== Lesson 09: Exception Handling ================================
"""The try block is used to test a block of code for errors. If an error occurs within the try block, 
   the program will immediately jump to the except block (if provided)."""

# The try Block

#<========================= Lesson 10: I/O File Handling =============================>
"""File handling is essential for reading and writing data to files, enabling persistent storage. 
   Python provides built-in functions and methods to handle files efficiently. 
   This tutorial covers the fundamentals with examples.
   Opening a File

Use the open() function to open a file. Specify the mode (read, write, append, etc.).

Modes:

r: Read (default)

w: Write (Opens the file for writing. Creates the file if it doesn't exist, or overwrites it if it does.)

a: Append (Opens the file for appending. Creates the file if it doesn't exist, or adds to it if it does.)

x: Exclusive creation (fails if file exists)

b: Binary mode (Used with the other modes (e.g., "rb", "wb") for working with binary files.)

+: Update mode (Can be combined with other modes (e.g., "r+", "w+") to allow both reading and writing.)"""

file.write("Hello, world!\n")  # \n creates a new line
